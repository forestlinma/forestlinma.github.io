  <div align="justify" class="STYLE2">
    <p>We have considered  four attributes, specifically face and people, clear foreground object, natural  scenery, and geometric structure. We define the clear foreground object  attribute as that the salient object should occupy the image region smaller than  50% of the source image. The natural scenery attribute means that a large  proportion of the image contains the texture or smooth information. And the  geometric structure attribute denotes that there are evident edges or lines in  the source image. The detailed attribute information of each source image is illustrated  in the following table. Firstly,  it can be observed that one image may contain more than one attributes.  Secondly, the dominant attribute of each source image is illustrated. We sort  the attributes of each source image according to the attribute importance.</p>
    <p>The attribute  information of the source image. (1 indicates the attribute of “face and people”;  2 indicates the attribute of “clear foreground object”; 3 indicates the  attribute of “natural scenery”; 4 indicates the attribute of the “geometric  structure”. The attributes are sorted according to their corresponding importance.  The left attribute denotes the most important, while the right one is the least  important.)</p>
    <p>Detailed information about the source image attribute information can be found in the <a href="Source Image Attribute Information.pdf">SUPPLEMENTARY</a>. </p>

    <p align="center"><strong>The obtained MOS value of each retargeted image after the subjective testing and data processing. The horizontal axes corresponds to the image number, and the vertical axes corresponds to the MOS value. The red star indicates the obtained MOS value for each retargeted image. The blue error bar indicates the standard deviation of the subjective scores. </strong></p>
  </div>
  <div align="justify" class="STYLE2">
    <p>There are in total  171 retargeted images in the built database. Detailed information about the retargeted image name and its  corresponding number are shown in the <a href="Retargeted Image Number.pdf">SUPPLEMENTARY</a>. It can  be observed that each source image shown in session 1 generates 3 retargeted  images by different methods and in different scales.</p>

  <div align="justify" class="STYLE2">
    <p>The perceptual qualities of the retargeted images in the database should span the entire range of visual quality and exhibit good perceptual quality separation. The histogram of the MOS values is illustrated above. It can be observed that the perceptual qualities of the images range from low to high values. Also it demonstrates that the subjective study samples a range of perceptual quality in an approximately uniform fashion. The image perceptual qualities exhibit a good separation.</p>
